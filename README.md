# Week-1---Intro-to-HTML-CSS

What is HTML ? It is a language used to structure web pages.It uses tags,which are enclosed in symbols <> opening and closed tags </> 
-an acronym that stands for HyperText Markup Language. Markup languages are different from programming languages. Whereas programming languages help us modify data, we use markup languages to determine how elements are displayed on a webpage.
HTML is usually stored in files that use the .htm or .html extension. A website can include hundreds or even thousands of these HTML files kept in various directories.

When you visit a web page, its server sends its HTML files to your browser. Your browser then reads the HTML in the files and displays it. Some web applications donâ€™t use static HTML but generate it in response to specific actions on their servers.
